    title: 'History',
    description: `Molecule Works Inc. (MWI) is a US-based technology company, registered in the State of Washington, and established in 2015 to pursue commercialization of three fundamental inventions licensed from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL): thin porous metal sheet, thin-sheet zeolite membrane, and cassette-type membrane module. Since then, MWI has successfully demonstrated scale-up of all the critical membrane preparation steps and established its proprietary pilot manufacturing capabilities for production of thin porous metal and zeolite membrane sheets. The pilot-scale manufacturing capabilities enable production of a large number of 20cm x 20cm membrane sheets for application prototype development and customer sampling.<br><br>
    MWI has developed several innovative manufacturing methods and processes for production of the porous metal sheet-based membrane products at low cost. MWI has also made a series of new inventions for applications of its membrane products.<br><br>`
